## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### "User not found" Error
**Problem**: The email address doesn't match any approved user  
**Solution**: 
- Double-check the email address for typos
- Confirm the person has requested and been approved for Hearth access
- Ask them to check their approval status

### "User not approved" Error
**Problem**: The person exists but hasn't been approved yet  
**Solution**:
- The person needs to submit a registration request
- An admin needs to approve their request
- Try sharing again after they're approved

### "Already shared" Message
**Problem**: You're trying to share with someone who already has access  
**Solution**:
- Check the current shares list in the modal
- Update their permission level instead of creating a new share
- Use the "Update" button to change their access

### Can't See Share Button
**Problem**: The Share button isn't visible  
**Solution**:
- Confirm you own the container (not just have access to it)
- Check that you have Admin permission if it's a shared container
- Only container owners and Admin users can share containers

### Permission Denied Errors
**Problem**: Getting permission errors when trying to access features  
**Solution**:
- Check your permission level (View/Edit/Admin)
- Confirm the feature you're trying to use matches your permission level
- Contact the container owner if you need higher permissions

## 💡 Best Practices

### Choosing Permission Levels
- **Start with View** - You can always upgrade permissions later
- **Use Edit sparingly** - Only for people who actively manage items
- **Reserve Admin** - For trusted co-managers only

### Managing Shared Containers
- **Regular reviews** - Periodically review who has access
- **Remove unused access** - Revoke access for people who no longer need it
- **Clear communication** - Let people know what level of access they have

### Security Considerations
- **Only share with trusted users** - Shared users can see all container contents
- **Monitor changes** - Keep track of who's making changes to shared containers
- **Use appropriate permissions** - Don't give more access than necessary
